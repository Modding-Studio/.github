# Modding studio
This project is a community Minecraft modding project: everyone can propose his ideas for mods to create, each project is then reviewed and approved by the administrators. Once this part is done, our devs can choose a project and realize it together.

Anyone can participate in this project: propose ideas, make textures, develop mods, set the mood in the discord üòÅ etc...

Don't hesitate to join our discord server to see the progress of the project : [discord link](https://discord.gg/F8nFtEYRuk)
